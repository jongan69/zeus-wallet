# Zeus Wallet: A Cross-Chain Bitcoin and Solana Payment Infrastructure

**Date:** May 13, 2025

---

## Abstract

Zeus Wallet is a cross-chain mobile application that enables seamless payments between the Bitcoin and Solana ecosystems. It empowers users to send payments using zBTC or any Solana token (e.g., USDC, BONK, WIF), while allowing merchants to receive native BTC. Built on the ZeusLayer and Zeus Program Library (ZPL), Zeus Wallet combines the high throughput and low fees of Solana with the liquidity and security of Bitcoin. This document outlines the architecture, functionality, and technical design of the wallet.

## Features

- **Multi-token Solana Payments**: Pay using any SPL token (e.g., USDC, BONK, WIF)
- **Automatic Conversion**: In-app token swap to zBTC using DEX aggregators
- **BTC Settlement**: Merchants receive native BTC via the ZeusLayer bridge
- **QR Code Support**: Scan & pay using Solana Pay and BIP21 QR formats
- **Secure Key Management**: Non-custodial wallets for Solana and Bitcoin
- **Transaction History & Receipts**
- **Custom Payment Requests**

## Architecture Overview

### Components

- **zBTC**: A synthetic BTC representation on Solana, backed 1:1 by real BTC
- **ZPL**: The Zeus Program Library coordinates minting, redemption, and bridging
- **ZeusLayer**: Bridge infrastructure to facilitate BTC ↔ zBTC interoperability
- **DEX Router**: Integrated with Jupiter for real-time SPL token swaps
- **Mobile App**: Built with Expo and React Native

## Token Flow

### 1. Pay with Any SPL Token

Users initiate payments in any supported SPL token:
- Meme coins (e.g., BONK, WIF)
- Stablecoins (e.g., USDC, UXD)
- zBTC

### 2. Convert to zBTC

The app uses a DEX aggregator (e.g. Jupiter) to convert the input token to zBTC.

### 3. Send zBTC

Converted zBTC is sent to the merchant’s Solana wallet.

### 4. Merchant Redeems zBTC to BTC

The merchant invokes the withdrawal process via ZeusLayer to receive native BTC.

---

## Step 4-2: Withdraw zBTC to BTC

### Purpose

- Convert zBTC back to BTC
- Exit Solana with native Bitcoin
- Settle merchant balances in hard money

### Flow Overview

1. User initiates withdrawal request
2. Selects appropriate guardian and reserve bucket
3. Constructs withdrawal instructions
4. Guardians approve and process BTC release
5. BTC transaction is broadcast

### Expected Duration

- ~24 hours average completion time
- Includes guardian approval, BTC transaction creation, and broadcast

---

## Security Model

- 1:1 BTC backing via guardian-managed reserves
- On-chain transparency for all zBTC issuance and redemptions
- Guardian quorum ensures decentralization of trust
- Tamper-proof withdrawal tracking via Solana + Bitcoin proofs
