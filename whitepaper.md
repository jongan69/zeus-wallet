# Zeus Wallet: A Cross-Chain Bitcoin and Solana Payment Infrastructure

**Date:** May 13, 2025

---

## Abstract

Zeus Wallet is a cross-chain mobile application that enables seamless payments between the Bitcoin and Solana ecosystems. It empowers users to send payments using any Solana token (e.g., USDC, BONK, WIF), while allowing merchants to receive native BTC. Built on the Zeus Program Library (ZPL), Zeus Wallet combines the high throughput and low fees of Solana with the liquidity and security of Bitcoin. This document outlines the architecture, functionality, and technical design of the wallet.

## Features

- **Multi-token Solana Payments**: Pay using any SPL token (e.g., USDC, BONK, WIF)
- **Automatic Conversion**: In-app token swap to zBTC using DEX aggregators (zBTC support coming soon)
- **BTC Settlement**: Merchants receive native BTC via the bridge (withdrawal flow implemented; minting and full bridge branding in development)
- **QR Code Support**: Scan & pay using Solana Pay and BIP21 QR formats
- **Secure Key Management**: Non-custodial wallets for Solana and Bitcoin
- **Transaction History & Receipts**
- **Custom Payment Requests** (basic support; advanced customization planned)

---

## Architecture Overview

### Components

- **zBTC**: A synthetic BTC representation on Solana, backed 1:1 by real BTC (zBTC as a payment currency and minting in development)
- **ZPL**: The Zeus Program Library coordinates withdrawal and bridging; minting and full bridge logic in development
- **Bridge Infrastructure**: Facilitates BTC ↔ zBTC interoperability (full "ZeusLayer" implementation in development)
- **DEX Router**: Integrated with Jupiter for real-time SPL token swaps
- **Mobile App**: Built with Expo and React Native

---

## Token Flow

### 1. Pay with Any SPL Token

Users initiate payments in any supported SPL token:
- Meme coins (e.g., BONK, WIF)
- Stablecoins (e.g., USDC, UXD)
- zBTC (coming soon)

### 2. Convert to zBTC

The app uses a DEX aggregator (e.g. Jupiter) to convert the input token to zBTC. (zBTC support coming soon)

### 3. Send zBTC

Converted zBTC is sent to the merchant's Solana wallet. (zBTC as payment currency in development)

### 4. Merchant Redeems zBTC to BTC

The merchant invokes the withdrawal process via the bridge to receive native BTC. (Withdrawal implemented; minting and full bridge logic in development)

---

## Step 4-2: Withdraw zBTC to BTC

### Purpose

- Convert zBTC back to BTC
- Exit Solana with native Bitcoin
- Settle merchant balances in hard money

### Flow Overview

1. User initiates withdrawal request
2. Selects appropriate guardian and reserve bucket (cold/hot reserve bucket logic in development)
3. Constructs withdrawal instructions
4. Guardians approve and process BTC release
5. BTC transaction is broadcast

### Expected Duration

- ~24 hours average completion time
- Includes guardian approval, BTC transaction creation, and broadcast

---

## Security Model

- 1:1 BTC backing via guardian-managed reserves
- On-chain transparency for all zBTC issuance and redemptions (minting in development)
- Guardian quorum ensures decentralization of trust
- Tamper-proof withdrawal tracking via Solana + Bitcoin proofs
